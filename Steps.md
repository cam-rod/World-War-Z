# Steps to get this to work

## Requirements

- RECURSION
- Open a file (does it need to save? does it need to print each time?)
- Expands zombie by 1 each time (Does each zombie get checked EACH TIME?)
  - Check if there are any zombies (Error catching)
  - Checks if 15 zombies in line (all directions) and defense
  
## Parts

- Open a file
  - Check if the file is valid (if Z=0, declare) (if not a box, declare: 15x40, no spaces) (only allowed characters: ```. Z H T W```
  - Read the file
  - Place each item into a nested list [column][row]
- Begin the zombie invasion
  - Generate a random number (0-3) for each direction
  - Determine what is in the corresponding spot
  - [ ] If a dot, fill
  - [ ] If a human, kill and check for other humans
  - [ ] If a zombie, skip
  - [ ] If a wall, check for 15 in a row, and then check if something behind it, then remove (can zombies block a wall from breaking? does the zombie immediately fill the space?) (then check for any other walls NEARBY to be broken)
